# Known Issues and Limitations

This document lists the current issues, limitations, and missing features in both the FastAPI backend and React frontend. It's intended to help with transparency and to guide future development efforts.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

Several major issues have been resolved in recent updates:

1. **WebSocket URL Construction**
   - Fixed URL construction in frontend's api.ts to properly connect to the backend
   - Changed from string manipulation to proper URL object handling

2. **Task Registry Reference Management**
   - Modified BrowserProcessPool.submit_task to always maintain a reference to the global registry
   - Fixed how registry references are passed between components
   - Added direct imports of the global registry at critical points

3. **Multiprocessing Resource Management**
   - Added proper cleanup of queues, semaphores, and other IPC resources
   - Implemented explicit close and join operations for queues in shutdown functions
   - Added resource cleanup for process termination

4. **Error Handling in WebSocket Connection**
   - Enhanced frontend error handling during connection attempts
   - Added connection status tracking with the hasConnected flag
   - Suppressed error messages during initial connection, only showing errors for disrupted connections
   - Added automatic clearing of error messages when connection is established

5. **Missing Time Import**
   - Added the critical missing import time in chat.py which was causing task creation to fail
   - Fixed task creation and timestamp generation

6. **Registry Persistence and Recovery**
   - Implemented registry snapshot saving to disk
   - Added automatic registry recovery from disk if empty
   - Added emergency task creation for cases where tasks aren't found

7. **Module Reloading for Fresh Registry References**
   - Added forced module reloading to get fresh registry references at critical points
   - Implemented registry consistency checks across different processes

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Empty Response Bubbles**
   - Tasks complete successfully but response content doesn't appear in chat bubbles
   - Backend is likely processing tasks correctly but the response format or content might be incorrect
   - Location: Interaction between `browser_process.py`, `chat.py`, and frontend components

2. **Task Duplication**
   - Tasks appear to be processed multiple times
   - This suggests potential issues with task distribution or completion detection
   - Location: `owl_api/services/owl_runner.py` and registry management

3. **Semaphore Leaks**
   - Still seeing semaphore leaks at shutdown (48 leaked semaphores)
   - While this doesn't affect runtime functionality, it's not ideal for clean shutdowns
   - Location: Multiprocessing resource management in `process_pool.py`

4. **Limited Module Compatibility**
   - Currently, only the `run_mini` module is fully compatible with the frontend
   - Other modules (run.py, run_groq.py, etc.) may not function correctly with the UI
   - Module switching in the UI may lead to unexpected behavior with non-run_mini modules
   - Location: `frontend/src/App.tsx` and module integration in `owl_api/services/owl_runner.py`

### API Backend Issues

1. **Process Management**: The process pool management for browser operations still needs further refinement.
   - Location: `owl_api/services/process_pool.py`
   - Fix needed: Improve cleanup of stale processes and add better monitoring

2. **Error Handling**: Some error cases in browser operations are not properly caught and reported.
   - Location: `owl_api/services/owl_runner.py`
   - Fix needed: Add more comprehensive error handling and reporting

3. **API Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting is implemented for API endpoints.
   - Location: Missing implementation
   - Fix needed: Add rate limiting middleware to protect the API from abuse

4. **Authentication**: No authentication system is implemented yet.
   - Location: Missing implementation
   - Fix needed: Add OAuth or API key authentication

## Frontend UI Issues

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some components don't display correctly on smaller screens.
   - Affected components: Conversation view, settings panel
   - Fix needed: Add responsive breakpoints and adjust layouts

2. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Dark mode styling is incomplete in some components.
   - Affected components: Various UI elements in `src/components/ui`
   - Fix needed: Complete implementation of dark mode theme across all components

3. **Loading States**: Some actions lack proper loading indicators.
   - Affected functionality: API calls, file uploads
   - Fix needed: Add consistent loading state indicators

## Integration Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection**: WebSocket connection handling has improved but still needs refinement in some areas.
   - Location: `frontend/src/services/api.ts` and `owl_api/ws/chat.py`
   - Fix needed: Further improve connection stability and error recovery

2. **API Endpoints Alignment**: Some frontend API calls don't perfectly align with backend endpoints.
   - Location: Various places in `frontend/src/services`
   - Fix needed: Review and standardize API calls and response handling

3. **Environment Variable Sync**: Changes to environment variables don't immediately reflect in the UI.
   - Location: Environment variable management in frontend and backend
   - Fix needed: Implement real-time updates for environment variables

## Missing Features

1. **File Upload/Download**: The file handling functionality is not fully implemented.
   - Location: Missing in both frontend and backend
   - Implementation needed: File upload component, API endpoints, and storage handling

2. **Agent Configuration**: Advanced configuration options for OWL agents are not exposed in the UI.
   - Location: Should be added to frontend settings and backend API
   - Implementation needed: Interface and API endpoints for detailed agent configuration

3. **Visualization of Agent Interactions**: Visual representation of agent interactions is limited.
   - Location: Should be added to frontend conversation view
   - Implementation needed: Interactive visualization of agent communication

4. **Session Management**: No way to save or restore previous sessions.
   - Location: Missing in both frontend and backend
   - Implementation needed: Session persistence and restoration functionality

## Performance Issues

1. **Large Response Handling**: The UI may become unresponsive with very large responses from agents.
   - Location: `frontend/src/components/conversation`
   - Fix needed: Implement virtualization or pagination for large responses

2. **Browser Process Management**: Browser automation has improved but can still be memory-intensive.
   - Location: `owl_api/services/process_pool.py`
   - Fix needed: Further improve process isolation and resource management

3. **WebSocket Message Size**: Large messages over WebSocket can cause performance issues.
   - Location: `owl_api/ws/chat.py`
   - Fix needed: Implement chunking for large WebSocket messages

## Backend Specific Issues

1. **Module Loading**: Dynamic module loading could be more robust.
   - Location: `owl_api/services/owl_runner.py`
   - Fix needed: Better error handling and module validation

2. **Task Cleanup**: Old tasks are not automatically cleaned up from the registry.
   - Location: `owl_api/services/owl_runner.py`
   - Fix needed: Implement a task cleanup mechanism

3. **Log Rotation**: Log files can grow large over time.
   - Location: Logging configuration
   - Fix needed: Implement proper log rotation

## Frontend Specific Issues

1. **State Management**: Some components manage their own state instead of using a centralized approach.
   - Location: Various components
   - Fix needed: Refactor to use consistent state management

2. **API Error Handling**: Error handling for API calls is inconsistent.
   - Location: `frontend/src/services`
   - Fix needed: Standardize error handling across all API calls

3. **Accessibility**: Some UI components need accessibility improvements.
   - Location: Various components
   - Fix needed: Add proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

1. **Fix Response Content Display**
   - Investigate how browser process results are formatted and returned
   - Check the WebSocket messaging format between backend and frontend
   - Verify how the frontend renders response content

2. **Resolve Task Duplication**
   - Implement a more robust task tracking system, possibly using a database
   - Add checks to prevent redundant task processing
   - Consider a centralized task dispatcher with better state management

3. **Clean Up Semaphore Leaks**
   - Improve resource cleanup during shutdown
   - Add explicit semaphore tracking and release
   - Consider alternative IPC mechanisms that might be more reliable

4. **Comprehensive System Testing**
